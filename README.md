```I implemented this app by breaking it down into three sections:```
#Add
##Display
###Reset

>`Add section` gives the user the feature of adding and completing/removing a project, likewise Actions. Actions are targets or work to be done under each project entity, this can be as many as possible and as small as none.

>The second section `Display` of the app allows you to view the actions you note down by using a dropdown select box where you will also see all the ongoing projects, clicking any of them will display the corresponding actions underneath.

>The last part is a simple `reset button`, recall this app uses local storage, so the reset button allows you to clear your entire storage for this app (not affecting other data saved in your storage), then it will refresh the window and you can have a fresh start.

```Future Work```

#First, I will implement this app storage with a simple filesystem to enable collaboration as a company while using my app, with nodejs as my server-side language. 
##Then I will advance to creating API integrated to the server-side to complete the whole development as required.
